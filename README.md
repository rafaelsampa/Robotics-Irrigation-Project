# Robotics Irrigation Project

This was a fun straight foward irrigation project using arduino UNO and several eletronics coponents that I've learned to utilize during this simester. The Ideia came within talking to my partner in the project [@tarsilaAmado](https://github.com/tarsilaAmado) and our dear Robotics professor Wilmer yecid Cordoba. Moreover, I would like to point out that the project evolution was documentated in our Academic Progress Report, you can find the original portuguese version as well as the english translated version attached to this repository.
